# Sorting Algorithms in Go

This Go module is designed to explore and understand popular sorting algorithms for educational purposes.

It includes implementations of standard algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and others, with clear and concise explanations. This project focuses on learning and applying best practices rather than production-grade performance or optimization.
